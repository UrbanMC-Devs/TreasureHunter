# TreasureHunter Configuration #
################################

# TreasureHunter only runs in one normal world! (not nether or end)
world: 'world'

#While hunting the treasure, by default, players won't be able to fly or use /god. You can disable this by setting either options to false;
disable-fly: true
disable-god: true

#Blocked Commands. What commands should not be allowed while treasure hunting?
blocked-commands:
-tpa
-tpaccept
-tpyes
-marry sethome

# So you've configured everything. Change this thingy from false to true and we can get you started!
# This is to prevent items you don't want being spawned in your world before you've configured the plugin.
ready: false
